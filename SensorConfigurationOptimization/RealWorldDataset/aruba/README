This dataset contains sensor data that was collected in the home of
a volunteer adult.  The resident in the home was a woman.  The woman's
children and grandchildren visited on a regular basis.

The following activities are annotated within the dataset. The number in
parentheses is the number of times the activity appears in the data.

Meal_Preparation (1606)

Sleeping (401)
Wash_Dishes (65)
Bed_to_Toilet (157)
Enter_Home (431)
Leave_Home (431)
Housekeeping (33)
Resperate (6)

The sensor events are generated from motion sensors (these sensor IDs begin
with "M"), door closure sensors (these sensor IDs begin with "D"), and
temperature sensors (these sensor IDs begin with "T").
The layout of the sensors in the home is shown in the file aruba.jpg.
